# Enhanced analyzeCodeWithAgent - MCP Integration

## Overview
The `analyzeCodeWithAgent` function has been significantly enhanced to integrate with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) system, providing AI with comprehensive access to local files and advanced file management capabilities.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. MCP File Access
- **Read access** to all three MCP folders:
  - `primaria/` - Source/input files (read-only)
  - `intermediario/` - Intermediate processing files (read-only)
  - `destino final/` - Final output files (read/write/create/delete)

### 2. Enhanced AI Context
The AI now receives:
- Complete file listings from all MCP folders
- File content previews (up to 2000 characters per file)
- File type information and extensions
- Project structure understanding

### 3. New MCP-Specific Actions
Three new suggestion types have been added:

#### `mcp_create`
- Creates new files in the "destino final" folder
- AI can generate complete file content
- Useful for creating utilities, configs, or documentation

#### `mcp_modify`
- Modifies existing files in the "destino final" folder
- AI can update content based on patterns from other folders
- Maintains file integrity and structure

#### `mcp_delete`
- Removes files from the "destino final" folder
- AI can clean up unnecessary or outdated files
- Helps maintain project cleanliness

### 4. MCPFileManager Class
New utility class that handles:
- File system operations in MCP folders
- Context formatting for AI prompts
- Error handling and validation
- Path resolution and security

## Usage Example

```typescript
// The function now automatically includes MCP context
const suggestions = await analyzeCodeWithAgent(options, files);

// Example suggestions the AI might generate:
[
  {
    "type": "mcp_create",
    "description": "Create utility module based on patterns from primaria folder",
    "path": "utils.py",
    "content": "# Utility functions\ndef helper():\n    pass",
    "mcpFolder": "destino final"
  },
  {
    "type": "mcp_modify",
    "description": "Update math processor with improved algorithms",
    "path": "math_processor.py",
    "content": "# Updated math processor...",
    "mcpFolder": "destino final"
  }
]
```

## AI Prompt Enhancement

The AI receives a comprehensive prompt that includes:

1. **MCP Folder Context**: Complete file listings and content previews
2. **Available Actions**: Clear description of what operations are possible
3. **Focus Areas**: Specific guidance on code organization and improvement
4. **Examples**: Sample response format and suggestion types

## Benefits

### For Developers
- **Automated Code Organization**: AI analyzes existing patterns and suggests improvements
- **Cross-Folder Learning**: AI learns from source files to improve final outputs
- **Intelligent File Management**: AI can create, modify, and clean up files automatically

### For AI
- **Rich Context**: Access to complete project structure and file contents
- **Actionable Operations**: Ability to perform real file operations, not just suggestions
- **Pattern Recognition**: Can identify common patterns across different project stages

## Security and Safety

- **Folder Restrictions**: AI can only write to the "destino final" folder
- **Content Limits**: File content is limited to prevent token overflow
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for all file operations
- **Validation**: All operations are validated before execution

## Integration Points

### With Converter System
- Uses existing MCP infrastructure from `converter.ts`
- Leverages `getLocalFilesInfo()` function
- Maintains compatibility with existing workflows

### With UI
- Enhanced suggestion display with MCP badges
- Content preview for file operations
- Improved error reporting and feedback

### With File System
- Uses `fs-extra` for reliable file operations
- Proper path resolution and directory creation
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for expansion:
1. **Multi-folder operations**: Allow operations across multiple MCP folders
2. **Template system**: Pre-defined templates for common file types
3. **Diff preview**: Show changes before applying modifications
4. **Rollback capability**: Undo operations if needed
5. **Batch operations**: Group related operations for efficiency

## Testing

The enhanced function can be tested by:
1. Running the Electron app
2. Processing some code files
3. Using the "Analyze with AI" feature
4. Observing MCP-specific suggestions
5. Applying suggestions and verifying file operations

## Conclusion

The enhanced `analyzeCodeWithAgent` function represents a significant step forward in AI-assisted code management, providing intelligent, context-aware file operations that leverage the full power of the MCP system.
